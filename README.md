Today, around 85% of machine learning models never make it to production. this is typically because of a combination of factors ranging from poor strategy, communication and infrastructure.

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of principles, best practices and ideas to deploy and maintain machine learning models. 

The high-level architecture for such a project is proposed below:
